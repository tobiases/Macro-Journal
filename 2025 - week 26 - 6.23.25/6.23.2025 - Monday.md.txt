The war continues.

## This happened over the weekend:
The B2 bombers returned after a successfull mission, bombing 3 major nuclear sites in Iran, the vrypto markets reacted by sneding $btc bellow $100,000. It quikly recovered and is back above 100k again.

## Whats next?

President Trump has promised that any reatalliation will be met with far greater force. I would not be surprised if Iran ignores this, however, if they do, they will quikly find out.
A lot of people didnt want the U.S. to get involved, I think it is our best option. Iran and Israel would/will continue to fight each other for months, this would be terrible for the markets. Hopefully Trump can end this war as soon as possible.

I dont think the markets will be red for to much longer, I would give it another two weeks before making any major decisions.
